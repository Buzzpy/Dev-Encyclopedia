# This is how  this works in a nutshell

You clone this repository, look at the markdown files in different directories in the project, and see what's included and what is missing. You can start from there or read the README.md file, which provides a high-level overview of the framework roadmap.

Once you have picked something you would like to work on, do it. Create a branch off the main branch, push to it, and then make a pull request. We will review it in no time and merge it in if it's okay, and that's it.

Except for the Z.Js file and a few others, most files are where they belong in subsequent project directories, so I don't mind some redundant files in some directories for now. Most will be removed soon, especially those in experiments!

That said, welcome on board. Just keep an eye on how we name things and how the project is structured. We want to stay consistent. Thank you!

Iâ€™m Kizz, by the way. It's nice to have you interested in this!
