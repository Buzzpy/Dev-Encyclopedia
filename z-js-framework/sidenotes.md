# Side Notes For The Curious

some questions are repeative and necessary, here some will be answered...

## ðŸ¤– Why Another Framework? Why Not, Listen Up <a name="why"></a>

As everyone is running for meta frameworks, server-side rendering, and all the new stuff out there in the Js frameworks ecosystem, some of us got fed up. The frontend is hard, so why make it harder with bloat and more mental overhead on devs? #DevsBrainsMatter

So, I needed something very simple that could make a plain HTML, CSS, and Js project have a modern developer experience, be scalable, and yet have the power of single-page applications (SPAs) or, not to say, reactive applications.

Nothing fancy, something to bring that easy feeling when you just go vanilla, using the bare minimums, but not less powerful having to repeat your implementations or copy-paste code as you do in vanilla projects due to lack of compose-ability and components model, these are things we could solve without becoming complex. We instead capitalize on intuitive architecture, native web platform features and principles instead of a bunch of libs, meta frameworks, build tools, and server sh*t that newer devs are not even familiar with usually.

> So, after months of work and learning, the Z Js framework is the fruit of the efforts to make a more straightforward, step-less Js framework that trades all the shiny stuff for simplicity and low mental overhead on developers. Are you tired of having to learn and always play catch-up on new framework features just to make a simple app? Try Z Js!

This is a work in progress and calling on all those who feel like modern js frameworks have become so bloated to contribute to Z, and we will make this awesome; of course, no shiny features allowed, Z doesn't plan to include server-side rendering or related stuff, just do it the old way, let your backend do its job, and here we handle frontend side, this is not another one size fits all thing, this is a client-side framework inspired by frameworks like react but not like them or another full-stack ferry, humbly it's just meant to be used for frontend only, and that's all!

## Roadmap And Features If You Like To Contribute <a name="roadmap"></a>

- âœ… Define framework usage and semantic basics
- âœ… Create a custom state management mechanism
- âœ… Create a simple way to persist state -- just use local storage or web storage
- âœ… Create a custom events-driven system for reactive UI updates
- âœ… Create a main Z binding layer to bring everything together
- âœ… Create UI templating and styling foundations
- âœ… Create common templating utilities (like for loops, conditionals, etc.) -- half way there!
- âœ… Handle single page application model and routing
- âœ… Handle automatic re-rendering on state change
- âœ… Add useful hooks and utilities for common patterns
- âœ… Add in builtin fetching and utilities for common data to UI patterns
- ðŸ”³ Add in builtin form utilities and enhancements
- ðŸ”³ Add in builtin promise utilities
- ðŸ”³ Add in builtin page transition and component transition animations
- ðŸ”³ Add builtin low boilerplate data fetching mechanisms
- ðŸ”³ Improve documentation and provide more examples
- ðŸ”³ Introduce Js doc and ship this for massive adoption!
- ðŸ”³ Add tests coverage to ensure more reliability and trust
- ðŸ”³ Do some benchmarks, refactoring and performance optimizations
