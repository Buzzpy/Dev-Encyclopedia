        "In cryptography, a symmetric key is like a shared password that both encrypts and decrypts data. This means the same key locks and unlocks the information, making it crucial that only trusted parties have access to it.",
        "Imagine you and a friend have the same key. You use it to lock (encrypt) a message, and your friend uses the same key to unlock (decrypt) it. The catch? You both need to keep that key safe and secret.",
