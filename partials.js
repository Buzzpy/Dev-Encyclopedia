          Think of eventually consistent systems like updates to social media profiles that might not show up immediately for all users but will eventually.

          Scalability is the capability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to accommodate growth.
        
          
        
        
          Think of scalability as the ability of a bridge to handle more traffic as the city grows.
