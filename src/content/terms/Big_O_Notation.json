      "Big O Notation is a mathematical concept used to describe the efficiency of algorithms, particularly in terms of time and space complexity. It provides a high-level understanding of how an algorithm's runtime or the amount of memory it uses grows relative to the input size.",
      "In practical terms, Big O helps developers evaluate and compare the performance of algorithms, especially when dealing with large data sets. Common Big O notations include O(1) for constant time, O(n) for linear time, and O(log n) for logarithmic time.",
      "Understanding Big O is essential for optimizing code and ensuring that software can scale efficiently as the amount of data or the number of users increases."
