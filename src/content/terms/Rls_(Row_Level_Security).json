            "RLS (Row-Level Security) is a feature in databases that provides granular control over access to individual rows within a table based on user roles or other attributes. This ensures that users only have access to the data they are authorized to see, enhancing both data privacy and security. RLS helps in enforcing security policies at a more detailed level than traditional table-level permissions."
