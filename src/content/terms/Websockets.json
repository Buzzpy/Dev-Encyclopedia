        "A websocket is a stateful communication between a client and the server.",
        "Like the HTTP/HTTPS, websockets is also an internet communication protocol that allows both the server and client to exchange data over the    web.",
        "However, while the HTTP establishes a new connection for each data exchange, websockets use a single network connection for client-server  interaction. This is why it is stateful.",
        "Websockets are often used in applications where there is frequent interaction between the client and the server, e.g chat applicatons, data streaming apps, trading apps, etc.",
        "With websockets' single network connection, a web page does not need to reload frequently for the client to exchange data with the server.",
        "The technology that allows you to send a message to a friend within a chat application without reloading the site is Websocket."
