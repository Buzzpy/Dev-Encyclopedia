      "In software development, a prototype is an early model of a system or software, created to test concepts and gather feedback before the final product is developed.",
      "Prototypes help in exploring ideas, identifying potential issues, and ensuring that the design aligns with the user's needs and expectations.",
      "They can vary in fidelity, from simple sketches or wireframes to interactive models that closely resemble the final product.",
      "Prototyping is a key part of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and is often used in iterative and Agile development methodologies."
