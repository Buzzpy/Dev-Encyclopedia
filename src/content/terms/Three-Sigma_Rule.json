      "The Three-Sigma Rule, also known as the Empirical Rule, states that for a normal distribution, almost all data points (about 99.7%) lie within three standard deviations of the mean. This rule is helpful for understanding the spread and variability of data.",
      "In practical terms, this means if you plot data on a graph with the mean and standard deviations marked, most of the data will fall within the range of three standard deviations from the mean."
