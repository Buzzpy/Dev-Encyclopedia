        "Polling is a method used to retrieve data from a server by continuously sending requests at regular intervals.", 
        "Unlike webhooks, which are event-driven and send data to clients automatically when changes occur, polling actively queries the server for updates, making it a proactive approach.",
        "It is commonly used in applications where timely access to fresh data is essential. For example, a crypto trading platform might poll a central database like Coinbase for the latest exchange rates.",
        "In this scenario, the platform repeatedly requests updates until it detects a change, ensuring users have the most current information.",    
        "However, polling can be less efficient than webhooks, especially if updates occur infrequently."
