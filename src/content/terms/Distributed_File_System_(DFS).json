      "A Distributed File System (DFS) enables files to be stored and accessed across multiple servers, providing scalability, reliability, and efficient data sharing. It abstracts the location of files, allowing users to access them as if they were stored on a single machine.",
      "DFS is widely used in enterprise environments to manage large datasets, improve fault tolerance, and enhance data accessibility across different geographic locations."
