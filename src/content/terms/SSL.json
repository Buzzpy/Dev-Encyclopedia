      "SSL, or Secure Sockets Layer, is an encryption-based Internet security protocol.",
      "SSL is primarily used to secure communications between a client and a server, such as a web browser and a website, or a mail server and a mail client. It can also secure email, VoIP, and other communications over unsecured networks. SSL prevents hackers from seeing or stealing information transferred, including personal or financial data."
