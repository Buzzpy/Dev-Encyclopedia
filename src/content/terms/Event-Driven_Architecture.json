      "Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is a software design pattern where the flow of the program is driven by events. These events can be anything from user actions, sensor outputs, or messages from other systems.",
      "Imagine it like a series of dominosâ€”when one domino falls (the event), it triggers a chain reaction (the response). This architecture allows for highly responsive and scalable systems, ideal for real-time applications."
