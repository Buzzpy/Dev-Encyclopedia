        "The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize the functions of a networking system. It divides the communication process into seven layers.",
        "These layers—Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application—each serve a specific purpose, such as routing, error handling, or encryption. This framework ensures interoperability between different systems and devices by breaking communication into manageable steps, fostering standardization across networks."
