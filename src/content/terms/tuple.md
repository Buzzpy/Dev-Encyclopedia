title: "Tuple"
subtext: "Immutable collection in programming"
description: "A tuple is a collection of items that are ordered and unchangeable. It's like a list, but once you create it, you can't change it.

Think of it like a grocery list written in pen. You can't erase or change the items once they're written down."
