      "Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a standard for pushing updates from a server to a client over a single HTTP connection. Unlike traditional request-response models where the client must repeatedly request data, SSE allows the server to send updates automatically as soon as new data is available.",
      "This technology is particularly useful for applications that require real-time updates, such as news feeds, stock price updates, or live chat systems. SSE is supported in most modern browsers and provides a simple, lightweight alternative to WebSockets for certain use cases."
