      "CQRS is a design pattern that separates the read and write operations in a system. The main idea is to use different models to handle updates (commands) and queries (reads) to optimize performance, scalability, and security.",
      "In a typical application, the same data model is used for both reading and writing data. However, in CQRS, you split the data model into two separate models: one for updates and another for reads."
