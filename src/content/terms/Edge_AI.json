      "Edge AI refers to the deployment of artificial intelligence on edge devices, enabling data processing to occur locally rather than relying on cloud computing.",
      "This approach reduces latency, enhances data privacy, and allows for real-time decision-making, making it ideal for applications such as autonomous vehicles, smart cameras, and IoT devices."
