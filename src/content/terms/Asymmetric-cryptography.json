      "Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public-key cryptography, is a cryptographic system that uses a pair of keysâ€”a public key and a private key. The public key is used to encrypt data, while the private key is used to decrypt it.",
      "This type of cryptography is fundamental in securing communications over the internet, enabling technologies like SSL/TLS, which protect sensitive data transmitted between a user and a website.",
      "Asymmetric cryptography provides a higher level of security than symmetric cryptography, as the private key, which is kept secret, cannot be derived from the public key."
