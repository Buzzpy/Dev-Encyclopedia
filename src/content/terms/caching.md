title: "Caching"
subtext: "Storing data for quick access"
description: "Caching is a technique used to store copies of frequently accessed data in a temporary storage area, or cache, so that it can be accessed more quickly.

Think of caching like keeping your favorite snacks in a drawer so you don’t have to go to the kitchen every time you’re hungry."
