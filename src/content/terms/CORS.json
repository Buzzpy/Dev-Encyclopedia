      "Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a security mechanism that allows web browsers to access resources from domains other than the one serving the application.",
      "For example, your application may use your browser to pull videos from a video platform API, use fonts from a public font library, or display weather data from a national weather database. CORS allows the client browser to check with the third-party servers if the request is authorized before any data transfers."
