      "Micro-batching is an optimization technique where small groups of data are processed in short intervals. It is commonly used in data streaming and real-time processing systems to balance the efficiency of batch processing with the responsiveness of real-time systems.",
      "By using micro-batching, systems can reduce latency and improve throughput, making it an effective approach in environments where data needs to be processed quickly and efficiently."
