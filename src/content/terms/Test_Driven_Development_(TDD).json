      "Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a methodology where tests are created before the actual code. The process involves writing a test, running it to ensure it fails, then writing the minimum code required to pass the test, and finally refactoring the code while keeping the test passing.",
      "This approach ensures that the codebase remains flexible and that new features do not break existing functionality. It emphasizes writing test cases that are small and focused."
