      "Client-side rendering (CSR) is a method of rendering web pages in the browser using JavaScript. With CSR, the initial HTML is minimal, and the content is dynamically generated by JavaScript once the page is loaded.",
      "CSR is commonly used in modern frontend frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular. It provides a more interactive user experience by enabling dynamic content updates and smoother transitions between different parts of a web application."
