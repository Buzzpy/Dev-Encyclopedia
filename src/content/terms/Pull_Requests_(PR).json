      "A Pull Request (PR) is a feature in version control systems, such as Git, that allows developers to propose changes to a codebase.",
      "When a developer completes a feature or bug fix, they create a pull request to notify others that their code is ready for review.",
      "Pull Requests facilitate collaboration by enabling discussions, comments, and suggestions on the proposed changes before they are merged into the main codebase.",
      "Reviewers can approve the PR, request changes, or reject it, ensuring that only quality code is merged into the project."
