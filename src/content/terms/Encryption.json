        "Encryption is a process that uses algorithms and keys to conceal a file, text, or any other content. It is widely used to securely transfer data or messages between two or more parties.", 
        "When data is encrypted, it is transformed into an unreadable format using an algorithm ensuring that even if it is intercepted, it cannot be understood without the proper decryption key.",
        "For example, a message like 'I am beautiful' could be encrypted into a string such as 'bchgtiuythnhuiol'."
