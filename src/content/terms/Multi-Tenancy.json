      "Multi-Tenancy refers to a software architecture where a single instance of the software serves multiple customers or tenants. Each tenant's data is isolated and remains invisible to others, while they all share the same software infrastructure.",
      "This approach is common in cloud computing environments, enabling efficient resource utilization, cost savings, and easier maintenance. It is widely used in SaaS (Software as a Service) applications."
