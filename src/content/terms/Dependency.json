        "A dependency, also known as a package, is a collection of code functions or modules packaged as a single unit of code.", 
        "These dependencies often consist of multiple lines of code designed to perform repetitive or complex tasks efficiently.",
        "This packaged code can be installed and used by developers to achieve specific results. For example, `Express` in JavaScript and `Pillow` in Python."
