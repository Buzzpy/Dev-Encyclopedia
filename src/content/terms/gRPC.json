      "gRPC is a high-performance, open-source framework developed by Google that enables communication between services in a distributed system. It uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers as the interface description language, and provides features like authentication, load balancing, and bidirectional streaming.",
      "gRPC is particularly well-suited for microservices architectures, where efficient communication between different services is crucial. It allows for different services written in different languages to work together seamlessly, making it a popular choice for building scalable and high-performance distributed systems."
