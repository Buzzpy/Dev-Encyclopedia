      "Precision and Recall are two crucial metrics used in evaluating the performance of a classification model.",
      "Precision measures the accuracy of the positive predictions made by the model, calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives.",
      "Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the completeness by calculating the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives.",
      "Together, these metrics provide a balanced view of a model's performance, especially in cases where the class distribution is imbalanced."
