        "Virtualization is the process of creating virtual versions of hardware or software, like operating systems or servers, that run independently on the same physical machine.",
        "Virtualization lets multiple virtual servers share one physical serverâ€™s resources. This allows developers to create and manage virtual servers easily, without dealing with the complexities of physical hardware.",
        "For example, platforms like Render manage the hardware but let users set up multiple virtual servers on top of it for hosting applications."
