      "WebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary instruction format designed to provide a safe, portable, and efficient compilation target for high-performance web applications. It allows code written in languages like C, C++, and Rust to run in the browser at near-native speed.",
      "Wasm is intended to complement JavaScript, enabling web applications to execute code faster and more securely. It is supported by modern browsers and provides a low-level virtual machine that executes bytecode in a sandboxed environment."
