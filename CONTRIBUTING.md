# Contributing to Dev Encyclopedia!

Found some important information missing? Please contribute and help improve this project. We welcome contributions of all kinds, whether adding new content, fixing typos, or suggesting new features.


`Note: This repository is maintained by a single backend developer, therefore, mistakes can happen. I try my best to provide feedback, review your commits, and do everything on time. Wish me luck!`

### Branch Workflow

This project uses the following branches:
- **`main`**: For deployment.
- **`develop`**: For active development.

All contributions should be made to the `develop` branch. This branch will be tested and reviewed before being merged into the `main` branch for deployment.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository:**
   - Start by forking this repository to your own GitHub account. This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account where you have full control.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Once you have forked the repository, clone your fork to your local machine to start working on the project.
   - Use the following command to clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/Dev-Encyclopedia.git
     ```
   - Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

3. **Create a New Branch (Optional but Recommended):**
   - We recommend creating a new branch for your changes to keep your `develop` branch clean and to isolate your work.
   - Use the following command:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature-branch
     ```
   - Replace `feature-branch` with a name that reflects the work you’re doing (e.g., `add-content`, `fix-typo`).

4. **Make Your Changes:**
   - Make the necessary changes to the HTML files or any other content in the repository.

5. **Commit Your Changes:**
   - After making your changes, commit them with a brief and descriptive message:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Brief description of the changes"
     ```

6. **Push to GitHub:**
   - Push your changes to your forked repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature-branch
     ```

7. **Open a Pull Request:**
   - Go to the original repository on GitHub and open a Pull Request (PR) from your branch to the `develop` branch.
   - Make sure to describe the changes you’ve made and why they’re beneficial to the project.

8. **Get Your PR Merged:**
   - Once your PR is reviewed and approved, it will be merged into the `develop` branch. After thorough testing, the `develop` branch will be merged into the `main` branch for deployment (please note that this may take 2-3 days).
   - Also note that some changes made to the `develop` branch might not make it to the `master` branch.
